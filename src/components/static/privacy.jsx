                Foodengo will always make sure we have a legal basis to collect
                and use your personal information. The legal basis we rely on
                will change depending on the type of information and the context
                in which we collect it. Our main reason for collecting and using
                your personal information is to perform our contract with you
                (i.e. to make sure you get your Order delivered when and when
                you want it), but we may also process it where it is in our
                legitimate business interests to do so. 4. International data
                transfers We may transfer your personal information to countries
                outside the one in which you are resident to other countries
                where Foodengo or our service providers have operations. The
                data protection laws of these countries may differ from the laws
                of your country but Foodengo takes care to implement appropriate
                safeguards to protect your personal information in those
                countries in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 5. Security
                Foodengo places great importance on protecting your information
                from and against unauthorised access and against unlawful
                processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. We
                implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to
                safeguard such information. 6. Data retention Foodengo will
                retain your personal information for no longer than is necessary
                to fulfil the purposes described in this Privacy Notice. We may
                also retain certain elements of your personal information for a
                period after you delete or deactivate your account for our
                legitimate operations such as record keeping and to comply with
                our legal obligations. Whenever we retain your information we
                will do so in compliance with applicable laws. 7. Your data
                protection rights You can access your account at any time to
                review and update your personal information. You can also

                restrict its processing or request that it be ported to a third
                party. You also have the right to unsubscribe from the marketing
                communications we send you by using the unsubscribe
                functionality in any marketing communication you receive from us
                or by amending your profile accordingly. 8. Links to third-party
                sites Our websites may, from time to time, contain links to and
                from third-party websites (for example, those of our partner
                networks, advertisers and affiliates). If you follow these
                links, please be aware that Foodengo is not responsible or
                liable for these third-party websites which will have their own
                privacy policies. 9. Updates to this Privacy Notice We may
                update this Privacy Notice from time to time in response to
                changing legal, technical or business developments. We encourage

                More information 1. Information we collect from you and why From
                time to time, we may receive personal information from third
                party sources, including advertising networks and social media
                platforms like Facebook but only where we have checked that
                these third parties either have your consent to process the
                information or are otherwise legally permitted or required to
                share your personal information with us. This information may
                include your likely demographic group. A. Information that you
                provide voluntarily Certain parts of our Services may ask you to
                provide personal information voluntarily. For instance:
                Registration information: When you create a Foodengo account,
                sign-up or fill in forms on the Services, we collect information
                about you including your name, address, telephone number, email
                address and the password you create. Transaction information: We
                collect information relating to your Orders, including payment
                information (e.g. your credit card number, PayPal email account)
                using the secure services of our payment processors. Payment
                operations are outsourced to our payment processors and we do
                not store your credit card information in our systems. We also
                collect delivery details (e.g. your physical address) to fulfil
                each Order. Information regarding your marketing preferences: We
                collect information about your preferences to receive marketing
                information any time you subscribe or unsubscribe. Feedback:
                When you post messages and reviews of the Services or you
                contact us, for example with a question, problem or comment, we
                collect information about you including your name and the
                content of your query. If you contact our customer support teams
                we will record and keep a record of your conversation for
                quality and training purposes and to aid in the resolution of
                your queries. Sensitive Information: We collect information that
                you provide when you contact us (such as through our call centre
                or by using our online forms). This information may include
                sensitive personal information, such as health-related
                information (allergies or dietary requirements) or information
                about your religion (such as if you only eat halal food). We do
                not require this information and we ask that you share this
                information with the food vendor only. However, there are some
                situations where you may nonetheless provide this type of
                information, for example if you make a complaint and in those
                circumstances we will only be collecting it with your consent.
                B. Information that we collect automatically When you access our
                Services, we may collect certain information automatically from
                your device. In some countries, including countries in Europe,
                this information may be considered personal information under
                applicable data protection laws. For instance: Activity
                information: We collect information about your usage of the
                Services and information about you from the content you create
                and the notifications or messages you post or send as well as
                what you search for, look at and engage with. Cookies and
                similar technologies: We use cookies and similar tracking
                technology to collect and use personal information about you
                (e.g. your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your device ID, your
                browser type and when, how often and how long you interact with
                the Services), including to facilitate interest-based
                advertising. For further information about the types of cookies
                and similar technologies we use, why, and how you can control
                such technologies, see our Cookies Policy. C. Information that
                we obtain from third party sources. From time to time, we may
                receive personal information from third party sources, including
                advertising networks but only where we have checked that these
                third parties either have your consent to process the
                information or are otherwise legally permitted or required to
                share your personal information with us. This information may
                include your likely demographic group. For instance: Analytics
                reports and market research surveys: We collect information from
                our third party affiliates about the way you respond to and
                engage with our marketing campaigns so that we can customise our
                marketing and Services accordingly. We may also receive
                aggregated information in the form of audience segments from
                third party sources in order to display targeted advertising on
                digital properties operated by organisations like Facebook and
                Google. Our use of collected information Examples of how we may
                use this information include: A. Information that you provide
                voluntarily Registration information The registration
                information you provide when you create a Foodengo account
                allows us to give you access to the Services and to supply them
                to you under our Terms. We also use this information to
                authenticate your access to the Services, to contact you for
                your views and to notify you of important changes or updates to
                our Services. Transaction information Your transaction
                information (such as the food items you add to your basket)
                allow us to process your Order and send you an accurate bill. It
                also helps us and any Food vendor you order with contact you
                where necessary. Foodengo may contact you by email, phone or SMS
                to give you status updates or other information or to resolve
                problems with your account or Order. A Food vendor may contact
                you by phone or SMS to provide you with status updates or other
                information regarding your Order. Where you pay for your Order
                with a mobile payment or digital wallet service provider (such
                as PayPal, Applepay or Pay with Google) we will send you
                transaction information via confirmation emails or SMS to the
                email address or phone number registered with that service
                provider (since this is required by those providers). Some food
                vendors on our platform use our third party delivery agents;
                these companies may use your information to provide you with
                status updates on the delivery of your Order. We will also
                analyse information on completed transactions and successfully
                delivered Orders on the basis of data matching or statistical
                analysis so that we can administer, support, improve and develop
                our business and Services. Our analyses also help us detect and
                prevent fraud or other illegal activities or acts prohibited by
                our Terms or any policies applicable to the Services.
                Information regarding your marketing preferences Foodengo may
                market to you, where permitted by law, by post, email,
                telephone, mobile (i.e. SMS, in-app messaging and push
                notification) about our products or Services. Where you have
                given your consent, we may share your information with third
                parties (e.g. other companies) in other sectors (such as food,
                drink and entertainment) so that they can tell you about goods
                or services which may interest you. If you don’t want us to use
                your data in this way or generally change your mind about
                receiving any form of marketing communications, you can
                unsubscribe at any time using the unsubscribe functionality in
                the communication you receive or by amending your profile
                accordingly. You may also be able to opt-out of push
                notifications at a device level (e.g. by way of your iOS
                settings). If you choose to unsubscribe from our marketing, we
                will keep a record of your preferences so that we don’t bother
                you with unwanted marketing in future. Feedback and reviews If
                you give us feedback we will use it to reply to your questions
                or queries, to provide customer support and resolve any problems
                with your Orders or with the Services. We will publish reviews
                that you send to us about the Food Vendors on our platform and
                our Services in general and we also analyse your feedback to
                improve and develop our Services and in order to enhance your
                experience. B. Information that we collect automatically When
                you access our Services, we may collect certain information
                automatically from your device such as your IP address, MAC

                this information may be considered personal information under
                applicable data protection laws. Activity Information We analyse
                your buying habits and how you interact with our Services so
                that we can suggest food options from new food vendors we think
                you would like to try. If you choose to share your geo-location
                with us, we may use this information to show you content that is
                local to you; this information will also help smooth the

                food, drink and entertainment sectors) so that they can contact
                you about goods or services which may interest you. We will only
                share your information with these third parties where you have
                given your consent. If you don’t want us to use your personal
                information in this way or generally change your mind about

                will keep a record of your preferences so that we don’t bother
                you with unwanted marketing in future. If any part of our
                business enters into a joint venture, purchases another business
                or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your
                information may be disclosed or transferred to the target
                company, or new business partners or owners or their agents and
                advisors. In these circumstances we will always inform the
                relevant entities that they must only use your personal
                information for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Notice.
                Any law enforcement or regulatory body, government agency, court
                or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary
                (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to
                exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to
                protect your vital interests or those of any other person. Any
                other person provided that you have given your consent to the
                disclosure. We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal
                information unless we have your permission or are required by
                law to do so. 3. Legal basis for processing personal information
                Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal
                information as described above will depend on the specific
                context in which we collect it. Our main reason for collecting
                and using your personal information is to perform our contract
                with you (i.e. to make sure you get your Order when you want
                it). However we will also use your personal information where it
                is in our legitimate business interests to do so (but only if
                our interests are not overridden by your data protection
                interests or your fundamental legal rights and freedoms). In
                some cases, we may have a legal obligation to collect personal
                information from you (e.g. in the event of legal proceedings) or
                we might need to process it or share it with others to “protect
                your vital interests” (this is legal speak for saving your life)
                or those of another person (e.g. in a case where another
                person’s life is in danger). If we ask you to provide personal
                information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a
                contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time
                and advise you whether the provision of your personal
                information is mandatory or not (and we’ll also explain the
                possible consequences of you not providing it). Similarly, we
                may collect and use your personal information in reliance on our
                legitimate interests (or those of any third party). Relevant
                legitimate interests include a) to market to you or make you
                offers that we believe will interest you; b) to analyse and
                understand how our services are used and so to improve them; c)
                for fraud prevention or prevention of other criminal acts; or d)
                to keep our systems secure. If you have questions about or need
                further information concerning the legal basis on which we
                collect and use your personal information, please contact us
                using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us”
                below. 4. International data transfers We may transfer your
                personal information to countries other than the country in
                which you are resident. Foodengo’s website servers are mainly
                located in the United Kingdom however our group companies and
                third party service providers and partners operate in a number
                of countries, including Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada,
                Colombia, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Mauritius, Mexico,
                Norway, New Zealand, the Philippines, Spain, Switzerland,
                Ukraine and United Kingdom. This means that when we collect your
                personal information we may process it in any of these
                countries. Whilst these countries may have data protection laws
                that are different to the laws of your country, you can rest
                assured that Foodengo takes care to implement appropriate
                safeguards to protect your personal information in those
                countries in accordance with this Privacy Notice. Some of the
                safeguards we rely on include, where appropriate, using the
                European Commission’s approved standard contractual clauses with
                our suppliers, intra-group transfer agreements (so that we can
                safely transfer your data between Foodengo and Softnergy group
                of companies all over the world) and contracting with Privacy
                Shield certified companies in the United States, where this is
                appropriate. 5. Security We place great importance on keeping
                your personal information safe and secure. As such, we put in
                place appropriate technical and organisational measures /
                industry standard technology to protect it from unauthorised
                access and unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and
                damage. The security measures we use are designed to provide a
                level of protection security appropriate to the risk of
                processing your personal information. Where you have chosen a
                password which allows you to access certain parts of the
                Services, you are responsible for keeping this password
                confidential. We advise you not to share your password with
                anyone and to use a unique password for our Services. We will
                not be liable for any unauthorised transactions entered into
                using your name and password. 6. Data retention Foodengo will
                retain your personal information where we have an ongoing
                legitimate business need to do so (for example, while you hold
                an account with us or to enable us to meet our legal, tax or
                accounting obligations). If you object to us processing certain
                categories of your personal information (including in relation
                to receiving marketing communications from us), we will retain a
                record of your objection to the processing of your information
                so that we can continue to respect your wishes. We will destroy
                or permanently anonymise your personal information at the point
                that we no longer need to process it for our ongoing legitimate
                business needs or for any legal reason. If this is not possible
                (for example, because your personal information has been stored
                in backup archives), then we will securely store it and isolate
                it from any further processing until deletion is possible. 7.

                data protection rights. Below is a summary of your rights in

                unsubscribe functionality in the communication you receive or by

                then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your
                consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we
                conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect
                processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on
                lawful processing grounds other than consent. You have the right
                to complain to a data protection supervisory authority about our
                collection and use of your personal information. We respond to
                all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise
                their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data
                protection laws. 8. Links to third-party sites Our website may,

                partner networks, advertisers and affiliates or to any number of
